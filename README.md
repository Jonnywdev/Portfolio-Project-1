## Introduction
This website presents Mozz's Pizza and BBQ, a catering company. Users will be people looking for a caterer for a private or public event and they will be able to find interesting content in a simple and easy way.

The main aim of this project was to produce a reponsive easy to use website, by only using HTML and CSS.

I got inspiration for this project off one of my current jobs at https://www.acebars.co.uk/ my boss always said he would love to rebrand so I thought that I would give it a go.
