The website consists of 8 pages. Four are accessible from a navigation menu. Three are news pages and one is a submission confirmation page for the contact form.

## Navigation bar
* Navigation bar is visable on the top of each page, it is responsive to screen size and will adapt when the size changes.

    - Home
    - Our Menu
    - About us
    - Contact us

#### Footer:
- The footer, on big and medium sized screens are the same, with the logo on the left and navigation links to the main site pages, underneath is the address and phone number, social media links and copyright section.

#### Home

- This section holds the hero image that covers the whole section.
- It also has an overlapping div which gives visiters the chance to go straight to our menu page.

- On big and medium screens. The cards are stacked in a row, each card has an image on top and a bit of information on the bottom.
- On mobile screens the 3 cards are stacked on top of each other in a row. The card is layed out differently too with the image on the left and the text on the right.
- All cards have a hover effect which adds shaddow to it, giving it the effect it's lifted above the rest.
- All cards are links to seperate pages that are unreachable on the main nav bar.

- It is a small section which gives the visiter the chance to jump straight to the contact us section.

## Issues Found During Site Development
- Horizontal scrolling bar on the bottom of the screen.
![Screenshot of page having issue with horizontal scroll](assets/images/hor-scroll.png)
The horizontal scrolling bar is only visable on the home page, so I new there was an element on that page that wasn't working properly. 
![Screenshot of page having issue with horizontal scroll, using unicorn releavler](assets/images/hor-scroll-u.png)
I used the [Unicorn Revealer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicorn-revealer/lmlkphhdlngaicolpmaakfmhplagoaln?hl=en-GB) extension to chrome browser which was very helpful. It helped me understand that my issue was within my hero image. I found that my section with ID hero-outer had a width of 120% instead of 100%.

- Issues with margin & padding as the screens get smaller.
![No gap between the header and the contact form](assets/md-images/no-gap.png)
I noticed that as the screen sizes got smaller the margin on the contact page wasnt working for some reason. I fixed the issue by giving the section with ID contact a position of relative and an element top of 150px.
## Performance Testing
I used [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website. I had to make a few changes that I needed to make to improve the scores. Screenshots and supporting text is presented below:

 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS
 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML
 All code passed with no errors or warnings.
